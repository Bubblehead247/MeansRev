"""
sectors.py — single source of truth for symbol → sector classification.

Used by:
  - screener.py  : tag each candidate with a sector + asset type, and persist
                   the map to sectors.csv (the "hybrid" draft step).
  - meansrev_main.py : enforce the per-sector position cap (config.MAX_PER_SECTOR).

Classification rules (first match wins):
  1. Sector / thematic ETFs  → their GICS sector (so they count alongside
     individual stocks in that sector, e.g. XLE + XOM both = Energy).
  2. Broad-market / international ETFs → one shared "Broad/Index" bucket.
  3. Individual stocks → sector from the persisted map (sectors.csv), which the
     screener drafts via yfinance. classify() can also look it up live.
  4. Anything unmapped → "Unknown".

Live code calls sector_of() — it reads only the static maps + sectors.csv and
never touches the network. classify() is the screener-side helper that may call
yfinance.
