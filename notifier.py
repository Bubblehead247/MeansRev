notifier.py — ntfy.sh push alert integration for the Mean Reversion Bot.

Two alert tiers:
  ⚠️  WARNING  RSI(2) ≤ 20 — approaching entry zone, heads-up only
  🚨  SIGNAL   RSI(2) ≤ 10 — entry signal fired, trade queued for next open

Alerts are fire-and-forget. If ntfy.sh is unreachable the bot continues normally.
